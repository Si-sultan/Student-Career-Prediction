# Student Career Prediction Project

For my final semester project in the BSc Computer Science program, I developed a Student Career Prediction platform, designed to analyze academic data and suggest potential career paths for students. This project uses data-driven algorithms to assess students' strengths, interests, and academic performance, providing personalized career guidance to empower better decision-making.

Special thanks to [DigiHelp](https://digihelp.co.in) India, for their guidance and resources, which were instrumental in helping me create an accurate and user-friendly prediction tool!
